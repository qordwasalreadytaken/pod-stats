# Qords PoD Info
The Path of Diablo analytics site seems to have been orphaned, at least temporarily, leaving a gap in available data and trends on PoD builds. This is my attempt to provide similar information, and although it's done in a different manner, the hope is that it helps users come to the same conslusions. 

The goal of this is not to replace the analytics site, but fill a hole until it (hopefully) comes back. 

This is a series of static web pages generated by some python scripts. The data used to create these is not real time, it's a snapshot in time that I plan to refresh on a regular basis.
